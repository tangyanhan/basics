# Dynamic Programming

Four steps for dynamic programming: 

1. Characterize the structure of an  optimial solution.

2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.

3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in bottom-up fashion.

4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.
